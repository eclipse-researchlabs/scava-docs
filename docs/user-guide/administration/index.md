 a task between a start date and an end date.
  * Monitoring Execution: which permits to run a task from a start date until the current date then to schedule the task execution each new day.
* Start date: the start time range of the analysis process.
* End date: the end time range of the analysis process.
* Metric Providers: the metrics available on the metric-platform through the extension points mechanism.

These tasks will be executed later to compute/calculate some metrics that will be used to measure the quality of the OSS projects during various period of time.
